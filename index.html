        <h3>Philosopher and Motivational Speaker</h3>
        <p>
          Hello everyone, I'm Fatema.To some, philosophy is considered to be one
          of the most mundane topic. This, most commonly, is due to the
          “unanswerable” questions which instil rage in the brains of students.
          Moreover, the idea that philosophy is useless is because people
          believe that it has nothing to do with the real world. To these people
          I would simply say this philosophy has everything to do with the real
          world. It is, in my opinion, a topic which solely focuses on the lives
          of humans and aims to answer questions or improve life.

        <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
        <p>
          First, let me introduce myself.I'm a full-time front end developer
          with 2 years experience.In that time, I've worked as a front-end
          developer for both a Forbes 500 consulting firm and a small company.
          This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second
          year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because
          I had no real experience doing web development — and not much
          programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java
          training I got from a few online courses.

            A full stack developer requires skills such as Front-end Languages
            and Frameworks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Backend Technologies and
            Frameworks (NodeJS, ExpressJS, Django, Flask, C++), Database
            Management Systems (MySQL, SQL SERVER and PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and
            Oracle Database), Version Control, and Web Hosting Platforms

          <p>
            A front end developer has one general responsibility: to ensure that
            website visitors can easily interact with the page. They do this
            through the combination of design, technology and programming to
            code a website's appearance, as well as taking care of debugging.
