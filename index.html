        <h3>Philosopher and Motivational Speaker</h3>
        <p>
          Hello everyone, I'm Fatema.To some, philosophy is considered to be one
          of the most mundane topic. This, most commonly, is due to the
          “unanswerable” questions which instil rage in the brains of students.
          Moreover, the idea that philosophy is useless is because people
          believe that it has nothing to do with the real world. To these people
          I would simply say this philosophy has everything to do with the real
          world. It is, in my opinion, a topic which solely focuses on the lives
          of humans and aims to answer questions or improve life.
